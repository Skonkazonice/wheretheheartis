coming up for air after drowning , probably died , yet there you are surfacing, breaking thrugh from the depths below, dark, cold, wet.seeing the stars above in the night sky...only to realize that all hell has broke loose around you , nothing is the same and those stars that you first saw are now starting to fall.
